    <div class="blog" id="intro">
        <h2>Intro Blog</h2>
        <p>Welcome to our website about mental health awareness made by Rishit Lalchandani and Dhairya Mehta. In this blog, we will talk about the features we have on our website, like the home screen, the disorders section, the blogs section, and the about us section.</p>
        <p>Anyway, to help you get started, let’s quickly walk through each one of these sections I just mentioned above.</p>
        <p>Firstly, the home screen is the main page you see when you first open the website, and is designed for easy navigation so users can easily find the important information they are looking for. Now, let's dive into some of the features on the home screen:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Our latest blog posts (like this one!) on various topics like mental health awareness and real-life people who have gone through this experience</li>
            <li>Quick links to key resources and support hotlines.</li>
            <li>Important statistics to help showcase the importance of mental health awareness</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Secondly, the disorders section, a tab you can find after clicking the button in the top right corner named “disorders.” This section introduces various types of disorders and their effects. Some disabilities in this section include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Anxiety Disorders</li>
            <li>OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder)</li>
            <li>Depression</li>
            <li>ADHD (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder)</li>
            <li>PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder)</li>
            <li>Bipolar Disorder</li>
            <li>Eating Disorders</li>
            <li>Suicide/Crisis Help (MHA)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Thirdly, we have the Blogs Section, this is where we share in-depth articles, personal stories, mental health awareness, and how-to about such disorders effectively.</p>
        <p>Fourthly, the About Us Section... Here you can learn more about us, Rishit Lalchandani and Dhairya Mehta, and our mission statement, which defines our goals and what we are trying to achieve with this website.</p>
        <p>Finally, we have the Forums section, where you can interact with others who might be going through a similar situation or disorder as you. This forum helps connect like-minded individuals together to just talk about life and other issues they might have on a day-to-day basis.</p>

    <!-- Blog 2 -->
    <div class="blog" id="features">
        <h2>Some cool features of our website and how we coded it</h2>
        <p>First of all, I would like to talk about a quick feature found all through our website, which is regarding buttons. When you hover over the buttons, the color changes or a shadow gets added to it, due to a pseudo-class called hover.</p>
        <p>Next, we used the HTML <code>input</code> tag (specifically type="text", type="email", type="password", etc.) for single-line inputs like your name for the book and appointment section. These text boxes are like areas where you can type in information needed for our code to perform. We also had a required tag to help give an error message if you tried to submit the form with nothing in the text box for the appointment section.</p>
        <p>Now for the Mental Health Check In, the user has to answer questions using a rating scale (1–5), and the system provides custom advice based on their scores. This was done by using if and else statements. Based on the number you selected, there will be custom feedback provided to help improve your mental health.</p>
        <p>Lastly, for the Forums section, we used a variable to store the input you type in the text box. This variable is in a class that is then displayed in the forum, so you can see what you and other people typed. This forum page allows people of all ages and genders to connect in a safe environment.</p>

        <h2>Healthy steps to improve your mental health</h2>
        <p>Mental health is a really important thing that we all need to focus on in our daily lives. Even though this may be hard to do, due to school and work, it is key to living a healthy life. So here are some small healthy habits you can take to improve your mental health:</p>
        <p>Firstly, make sure you get enough sleep, which is around 7-8 hours daily. This allows your brain to rest and process emotions better. This helps reduce stress and anxiety. Try to also sleep by 9-ish every night and not stay awake till 11 pm, as it can be very detrimental to your body if done constantly.</p>
        <p>Second, maintaining an active lifestyle is crucial. Playing sports, exercising, walking, and stretching are examples of activities that can improve mental clarity and energy levels. Try to do this for at least 1 hour a day to keep your mental health good.</p>
        <p>Thirdly, diet is crucial. To sustain consistent energy levels and enhance brain function, try to eat fruits, vegetables, and protein. Alongside this, try to consume 1.5 litres of water per day. If you occasionally eat fast food, that's okay, but try not to make it a habit, and create an equal balance with the amount of unhealthy and healthy food you consume.</p>
