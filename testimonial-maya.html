                <p>
                    When I first started thinking about this series, I knew I wanted the opening story to be one I understood deeply, something that showed how hope can grow even in the darkest situations. I wanted a story about finding light again. Eventually, I realized the best story to begin with was my own.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've struggled with depression for most of my life. Now in my early 40s, and having worked at MHAEM for almost three years, I finally feel like I'm doing work that matters. After spending most of my adult life in IT, miserable and unfulfilled, this job has given me direction and purpose. I used to roll my eyes when people said, "If you love what you do, you'll never work a day in your life," but now I truly understand what they meant. My belief that people are capable of goodness, and that helping each other is what makes us human, has always guided me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But about a year and a half ago, something happened that made those beliefs feel like they were falling apart. I went into a deep depressive spiral, what I call my "valley days." Everything felt heavy, dull, and hopeless. I dragged myself to work feeling angry, bitter, and disconnected from the world around me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, in the middle of one of those dark days, I remembered where I worked. Part of my job is answering calls and giving referrals. One day, a woman called crying, not because she was upset, but because she was grateful. Our PATH team had found her a warm bed after she'd been living out of her car. Her gratitude over something so basic reminded me how life-changing small acts of kindness can be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More stories kept coming. I heard about colleagues who intervened in a suicidal crisis and got someone the help they desperately needed. I heard people describe our teams as "life savers." I saw how our programs helped clients find stability. It felt like the universe was sending me reminder after reminder of the quiet, powerful good that happens here every day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These acts of compassion, big and small, began to pull me out of my darkness. My coworkers and mentors didn't just help others; without even knowing it, they were helping me too. Their kindness slowly rebuilt me, piece by piece, and reignited the sense of purpose I had lost. I'm still healing, but I'm no longer drowning in bitterness or anger. Climbing out of a valley takes time, but I'm moving forward day by day, guided by the hope this organization creates. And really, that's the heart of it: being here helped me rediscover hope.
